## Description

Its 2D map is made up of a grid of tiles 100x100 NFT pixels, each pixel is divided into 10x10=100 sub-pixels.
Pixel owners can advertise things by putting the image on pixels, then it becomes land and can put more images inside.

We are building games to attract more traffic and bring users a new kind of experience where they can play, share, and explore exciting things at the same time.

Unlike most of the metaverse projects that spend so many resources on building fancy 3D Worlds, we simplify the graphic aspect and focus on decentralized activities and protocols.
