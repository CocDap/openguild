Hi there, my name is Tin Chung. I am a Vietnamese programmer and I am really into fundamental research.

As a highly motivated and enthusiastic individual, I am a dedicated blockchain researcher and system engineer with a passion for Rust system language and low-level programming. Through my studies and professional experience, I have developed a strong set of technical skills in Assembly, C++, Rust, and blockchain technologies.

I am committed to staying current with the latest industry developments and advancements in technology. Furthermore, I am a strong collaborator and enjoy contributing to open-source projects. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to drive innovation and make a positive impact in the field of blockchain and system engineering.

I write blog on multiple platforms, but the most popular one would be my Vietnamese blog Góc Của Chung.
