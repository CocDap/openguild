# About the LowLevelers community

_Language_: English

_Source_: [lowlevelers](https://github.com/lowlevelers)

## Who are we?

OpenGuild is a group of programmers who are passionate into discovering the field of low-level programming.

## What is our inspiration?

Back to a few years ago, I took a profound inspiration from **John Carmack** in the book **"Master of Doom"**. In an era when every kid aspired to unravel the mysteries of the Apple II computer, Carmack stood out as a luminary guiding the way. His journey, as vividly depicted in the pages of the book, became a roadmap for countless enthusiasts, myself included.

Carmack's relentless pursuit of knowledge and mastery of programming intricacies resonated deeply with a generation hungry for technological prowess. The Apple II, with its distinctive design and pioneering capabilities, became the canvas upon which these young minds painted their dreams of digital innovation. Carmack's narrative illuminated the path towards understanding the inner workings of this revolutionary machine, fostering a community of aspiring technophiles.

## Why are we here?

During my university time, I have always been taught the high-level programming languages and narrow technological concepts like web development and web design.

In a Vietnamese educational landscape that predominantly emphasizes the high-level applications of computers, OpenGuild emerge as a unique cohort of programmers. our passion lies in unraveling the mysteries of low-level programming, delving into the core intricacies of computer hardware, assembly language, and system optimization.

As pioneers in our pursuit, OpenGuild defy the norm, challenging the conventional focus on high-level programming prevalent in Vietnam. Through collaboration and shared exploration, we seek to expand not only our individual skill sets but also the collective understanding of low-level programming within our community. In doing so, OpenGuild contribute to a deeper comprehension of computer systems, pushing the boundaries of knowledge in a country where computer education often stops at surface-level applications.
