# Chapter 6 - Move semantics

## Exercise 1

```rust
fn main() {
    let vec0 = vec![22, 44, 66];

    let vec1 = fill_vec(vec0);

    assert_eq!(vec1, vec![22, 44, 66, 88]);
}

fn fill_vec(vec: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let vec = vec;

    vec.push(88);

    vec
}
```

We got this error `cannot borrow as mutable`. In the fill_vec function, we're trying to push a new element to the vector, so we need to meake the vec mutable. <br />
1 thing interesting here is that the vec0 is moved to vec1, and we can't access the vec0 anymore after calling the fill_vec function. <br />


```rust
fn main() {
    let vec0 = vec![22, 44, 66];

    let vec1 = fill_vec(vec0);

    // If you try access vec0 here, like `println!("vec0 is: {:?}", vec0);`, you will get this error: fill_vec's parameter takes ownership of the value
    assert_eq!(vec1, vec![22, 44, 66, 88]);
}

fn fill_vec(vec: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let vec = vec;

    vec.push(88);

    vec
}
```

## Exercise 2

```rust
#[test]
fn main() {
    let vec0 = vec![22, 44, 66];

    let mut vec1 = fill_vec(vec0);

    assert_eq!(vec0, vec![22, 44, 66]);
    assert_eq!(vec1, vec![22, 44, 66, 88]);
}

fn fill_vec(vec: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut vec = vec;

    vec.push(88);

    vec
}
```

The same as the exercise above, because the vec0 was moved to the function, so we can't access it anymore. <br />
To fix this, we can use the `clone` function to clone the vec0 and pass it to the function <br />

```rust
#[test]
fn main() {
    let vec0 = vec![22, 44, 66];

    let mut vec1 = fill_vec(vec0.clone());

    assert_eq!(vec0, vec![22, 44, 66]);
    assert_eq!(vec1, vec![22, 44, 66, 88]);
}

fn fill_vec(vec: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut vec = vec;

    vec.push(88);

    vec
}
```

## Exercise 3

```rust
#[test]
fn main() {
    let vec0 = vec![22, 44, 66];

    let mut vec1 = fill_vec(vec0);

    assert_eq!(vec1, vec![22, 44, 66, 88]);
}

fn fill_vec(vec: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    vec.push(88);

    vec
}
```

The same as the exercise 1, we can't push a new element to the vector because the vector is not mutable. <br />
We can make it mutable by using the `mut` keyword before the function parameter<br />

```rust
#[test]
fn main() {
    let vec0 = vec![22, 44, 66];

    let mut vec1 = fill_vec(vec0);

    assert_eq!(vec1, vec![22, 44, 66, 88]);
}

fn fill_vec(mut vec: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    vec.push(88);

    vec
}
```

## Exercise 4

```rust
#[test]
fn main() {
    let vec0 = vec![22, 44, 66];

    let mut vec1 = fill_vec(vec0);

    assert_eq!(vec1, vec![22, 44, 66, 88]);
}

// `fill_vec()` no longer takes `vec: Vec<i32>` as argument - don't change this!
fn fill_vec() -> Vec<i32> {
    // Instead, let's create and fill the Vec in here - how do you do that?
    let mut vec = vec;

    vec.push(88);

    vec
}
```

> `fill_vec()` no longer takes `vec: Vec<i32>` as argument - don't change this!
We don't need to pass the argument to the function anymore, so we can remove it. <br />
Just initialize the vector in the function and push the new element to it. <br />

```rust
#[test]
fn main() {
    let mut vec1 = fill_vec();

    assert_eq!(vec1, vec![22, 44, 66, 88]);
}

// `fill_vec()` no longer takes `vec: Vec<i32>` as argument - don't change this!
fn fill_vec() -> Vec<i32> {
    // Instead, let's create and fill the Vec in here - how do you do that?
    let mut vec = vec![22, 44, 66];

    vec.push(88);

    vec
}
```

## Exercise 5

```rust
// Make me compile only by reordering the lines in `main()`, but without adding,
// changing or removing any of them.

#[test]
fn main() {
    let mut x = 100;
    let y = &mut x;
    let z = &mut x;
    *y += 100;
    *z += 1000;
    assert_eq!(x, 1200);
}
```

We got this error `cannot borrow `x` as mutable more than once at a time`. <br />
Do you know what we have to do ?

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 100;
    let y = &mut x;
    *y += 100;
    let z = &mut x;
    *z += 1000;
    assert_eq!(x, 1200);
}
```

Just reordering to make sure that we borrow the x only once at a time. 

## Exercise 6

```rust
// You can't change anything except adding or removing references.

fn main() {
    let data = "Rust is great!".to_string();

    get_char(data);

    string_uppercase(&data);
}

// Should not take ownership
fn get_char(data: String) -> char {
    data.chars().last().unwrap()
}

// Should take ownership
fn string_uppercase(mut data: &String) {
    data = &data.to_uppercase();

    println!("{}", data);
}
```

The get_char function should not take the ownership of the data, so we can use the `&` before the data to pass the reference to the function. <br />
Otherwise, the string_uppercase function should take the ownership of the data, so we can remove the `&` before the data to pass the data to the function. <br />

```rust

fn main() {
    let data = "Rust is great!".to_string();

    get_char(&data);
    println!("This is my data: {}", data); // Result: This is my data: Rust is great!
    string_uppercase(data);
    println!("This is my data: {}", data); // Result: Error `borrow of moved value: `data``
}

// Should not take ownership
fn get_char(data: &String) -> char {
    data.chars().last().unwrap()
}

// Should take ownership
fn string_uppercase(mut data: String) {
    data = data.to_uppercase();

    println!("{}", data);
}
```
