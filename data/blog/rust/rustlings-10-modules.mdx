# Chapter 10 - Modules

## Exercise 1

```rust
mod sausage_factory {
    // Don't let anybody outside of this module see this!
    fn get_secret_recipe() -> String {
        String::from("Ginger")
    }

    fn make_sausage() {
        get_secret_recipe();
        println!("sausage!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    sausage_factory::make_sausage();
}
```

We can see here:
- The `get_secret_recipe()` method is private, only accessible inside the module
- The `make_sausage()` method is public, accessible outside the module
All methods are private by default, so we need to add `pub` keyword to make it public.

```rust
mod sausage_factory {
    // Don't let anybody outside of this module see this!
    fn get_secret_recipe() -> String {
        String::from("Ginger")
    }

    pub fn make_sausage() {
        get_secret_recipe();
        println!("sausage!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    sausage_factory::make_sausage();
}
```

## Exercise 2

```rust
// You can bring module paths into scopes and provide new names for them with
// the 'use' and 'as' keywords. Fix these 'use' statements to make the code
// compile.
mod delicious_snacks {
    // TODO: Fix these use statements
    use self::fruits::PEAR as ???
    use self::veggies::CUCUMBER as ???

    mod fruits {
        pub const PEAR: &'static str = "Pear";
        pub const APPLE: &'static str = "Apple";
    }

    mod veggies {
        pub const CUCUMBER: &'static str = "Cucumber";
        pub const CARROT: &'static str = "Carrot";
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!(
        "favorite snacks: {} and {}",
        delicious_snacks::fruit,
        delicious_snacks::veggie
    );
}
```

> You can bring module paths into scopes and provide new names for them with the 'use' and 'as' keywords

Looking at the main function, we can see that the module `delicious_snacks` has 2 paths is fruit and veggie. <br />
We can update the use statement like this to use them:

```rust
mod delicious_snacks {
    pub use self::fruits::PEAR as fruit;
    pub use self::veggies::CUCUMBER as veggie;

    mod fruits {
        pub const PEAR: &'static str = "Pear";
        pub const APPLE: &'static str = "Apple";
    }

    mod veggies {
        pub const CUCUMBER: &'static str = "Cucumber";
        pub const CARROT: &'static str = "Carrot";
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!(
        "favorite snacks: {} and {}",
        delicious_snacks::fruit,
        delicious_snacks::veggie
    );
}
```

## Exercise 3

```rust
// You can use the 'use' keyword to bring module paths from modules from
// anywhere and especially from the Rust standard library into your scope. Bring
// SystemTime and UNIX_EPOCH from the std::time module. Bonus style points if
// you can do it with one line!

// TODO: Complete this use statement
use ???

fn main() {
    match SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) {
        Ok(n) => println!("1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC was {} seconds ago!", n.as_secs()),
        Err(_) => panic!("SystemTime before UNIX EPOCH!"),
    }
}
```

Imagine keyword `use` is like `import` in Python or javascript. <br />
We can use it like this:

```rust
use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH};

fn main() {
    match SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) {
        Ok(n) => println!("1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC was {} seconds ago!", n.as_secs()),
        Err(_) => panic!("SystemTime before UNIX EPOCH!"),
    }
}
```
