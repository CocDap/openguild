# Chapter 20 - Threads

## Exercise 1

```rust
// This program spawns multiple threads that each run for at least 250ms, and
// each thread returns how much time they took to complete. The program should
// wait until all the spawned threads have finished and should collect their
// return values into a vector.

use std::thread;
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

fn main() {
    let mut handles = vec![];
    for i in 0..10 {
        handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            let start = Instant::now();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(250));
            println!("thread {} is complete", i);
            start.elapsed().as_millis()
        }));
    }

    let mut results: Vec<u128> = vec![];
    for handle in handles {
        // TODO: a struct is returned from thread::spawn, can you use it?
    }

    if results.len() != 10 {
        panic!("Oh no! All the spawned threads did not finish!");
    }

    println!();
    for (i, result) in results.into_iter().enumerate() {
        println!("thread {} took {}ms", i, result);
    }
}
```

We can use the `join` method to wait for the thread to finish and return a result. <br />
Add the result to results vector to pass the test.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut handles = vec![];
    for i in 0..10 {
        handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            let start = Instant::now();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(250));
            println!("thread {} is complete", i);
            start.elapsed().as_millis()
        }));
    }

    let mut results: Vec<u128> = vec![];
    for handle in handles {
        results.push(handle.join().unwrap());
    }

    if results.len() != 10 {
        panic!("Oh no! All the spawned threads did not finish!");
    }

    println!();
    for (i, result) in results.into_iter().enumerate() {
        println!("thread {} took {}ms", i, result);
    }
}
```

## Exercise 2

```rust
// Building on the last exercise, we want all of the threads to complete their
// work but this time the spawned threads need to be in charge of updating a
// shared value: JobStatus.jobs_completed

use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

struct JobStatus {
    jobs_completed: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let status = Arc::new(JobStatus { jobs_completed: 0 });
    let mut handles = vec![];
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let status_shared = Arc::clone(&status);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(250));

            
            status_shared.jobs_completed += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
        // TODO: Print the value of the JobStatus.jobs_completed. Did you notice
        // anything interesting in the output? Do you have to 'join' on all the
        // handles?
        println!("jobs completed {}", ???);
    }
}

```

To make the code compile, we need to use `Mutex` to make the `jobs_completed` field mutable. <br />
Read more about Mutex and Arc here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-03-shared-state.html

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

struct JobStatus {
    jobs_completed: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let status = Arc::new(JobStatus { jobs_completed: Mutex::new(0) });
    let mut handles = vec![];
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let status_shared = Arc::clone(&status);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(250));
            let mut count = let mut count = status_shared.jobs_completed.lock().unwrap();
            *count += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
        // TODO: Print the value of the JobStatus.jobs_completed. Did you notice
        // anything interesting in the output? Do you have to 'join' on all the
        // handles?
    }
    println!("jobs completed {}", Arc::clone(&status).jobs_completed.lock().unwrap());

}
```

> Print the value of the JobStatus.jobs_completed. Did you notice anything interesting in the output? Do you have to 'join' on all the handles?

The all outputs is 10. Seems we don't need to join on all the handles. Let try with join on only one handle.

```rust
for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
        break;
    }
println!("jobs completed {}", Arc::clone(&status).jobs_completed.lock().unwrap());
// Result: jobs completed 10
```

## Exercise 3

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

struct Queue {
    length: u32,
    first_half: Vec<u32>,
    second_half: Vec<u32>,
}

impl Queue {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Queue {
            length: 10,
            first_half: vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
            second_half: vec![6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        }
    }
}

fn send_tx(q: Queue, tx: mpsc::Sender<u32>) -> () {
    let qc = Arc::new(q);
    let qc1 = Arc::clone(&qc);
    let qc2 = Arc::clone(&qc);

    thread::spawn(move || {
        for val in &qc1.first_half {
            println!("sending {:?}", val);
            tx.send(*val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });

    thread::spawn(move || {
        for val in &qc2.second_half {
            println!("sending {:?}", val);
            tx.send(*val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });
}

#[test]
fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let queue = Queue::new();
    let queue_length = queue.length;

    send_tx(queue, tx);

    let mut total_received: u32 = 0;
    for received in rx {
        println!("Got: {}", received);
        total_received += 1;
    }

    println!("total numbers received: {}", total_received);
    assert_eq!(total_received, queue_length)
}
```

> An alternate way to handle concurrency between threads is to use a mpsc (multiple producer, single consumer) channel to communicate

We need clone the Sender to send to multiple threads.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

struct Queue {
    length: u32,
    first_half: Vec<u32>,
    second_half: Vec<u32>,
}

impl Queue {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Queue {
            length: 10,
            first_half: vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
            second_half: vec![6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        }
    }
}

fn send_tx(q: Queue, tx: mpsc::Sender<u32>) -> () {
    let qc = Arc::new(q);
    let qc1 = Arc::clone(&qc);
    let qc2 = Arc::clone(&qc);
    let tx1 = mpsc::Sender::clone(&tx);
    let tx2 = mpsc::Sender::clone(&tx);

    thread::spawn(move || {
        for val in &qc1.first_half {
            println!("sending {:?}", val);
            tx1.send(*val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });

    thread::spawn(move || {
        for val in &qc2.second_half {
            println!("sending {:?}", val);
            tx2.send(*val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });
}

#[test]
fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let queue = Queue::new();
    let queue_length = queue.length;

    send_tx(queue, tx);

    let mut total_received: u32 = 0;
    for received in rx {
        println!("Got: {}", received);
        total_received += 1;
    }

    println!("total numbers received: {}", total_received);
    assert_eq!(total_received, queue_length)
}
```
